# Chat-Controls-Wizard101
The script I use in my twitch chat controls Wizard101 streams.

```There will be no support on setting this script up besides the instructions provided.```

# TwitchPlays
These are the three Python files I use that allows Twitch Chat or Youtube Chat to control your keyboard or mouse to play a game. You are welcome to use or adapt this code for your own content.

While using this, I recommendd you use VSC to edit the script. (https://code.visualstudio.com)
To run the code you will need to install Python 3.9. (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/) 

Additionally, you will need to install the following python modules using Pip (In the VSC terminal, type the following lines individually): 

python -m pip install keyboard  
python -m pip install pydirectinput  
python -m pip install pyautogui  
python -m pip install pynput  
python -m pip install requests  

Once Python is set up, simply change the Twitch username (or Youtube channel ID) in the bot.py file, and you'll be ready to go.

Just run "py bot.py" in the VSC terminal, or run the python file in the folder directly.
